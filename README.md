## Description

A REST API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends‚Äô thoughts, and create a friend list.

##  User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

- Testing API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON

- Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts

- Testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list.

## üíª Usage

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine (
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Run `npm start` to run the server and make the API live
- Use your browser or an app like Insomnia to test the REST API.
- Models
    - User
    - Thought
    - Reaction (used as a subdocument in Thought)
    - Friends (used as a subdocument in User)
